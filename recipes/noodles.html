        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Noodles is the Asian culinary dish</p>
        <p>This is the stir fried noodles with vegetables</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>¼ cup oil, divided, or as needed</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>3 ½ cups trimmed and chopped fresh green beans</li>
            <li>5 mushrooms, sliced</li>
            <li>1 green bell pepper, cut into matchsticks</li>
            <l>1 carrot, cut into matchsticks</l>
            <l>1 (10 ounce) package egg noodles</l>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a large skillet over high heat.<br>
                 Whisk eggs together in a bowl. Pour into the skillet and stir-fry quickly until lightly set, about 2 minutes.<br>
                  Remove from heat and transfer to a large plate. Set aside. 
            </li>
            <li>Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a wok over high heat. Add green beans, mushrooms, bell pepper, and carrot; stir-fry for 2 to 3 minutes.<br>
                 Remove from heat and transfer to a large plate; set aside. 
            </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rapid boil.<br>
                 Cook egg noodles at a boil until they are just starting to soften, but are still pretty firm, about 4 minutes.<br>
                  Drain and rinse cooked noodles under cold running water. Drain and separate.<br>
                 Transfer to a bowl and add just enough oil to coat the noodles so they won't clump together. 
            </li>
            <li>Whisk water, light soy sauce, soybean paste, oyster sauce, dark soy sauce, and sesame oil together in a bowl until sauce is well combined. </li>
            <li>Combine cooked noodles, vegetables, eggs, and sauce in the same wok and stir fry over medium-high heat until everything is warmed through and noodles and vegetables are cooked to your liking, 1 to 2 minutes. <br>
                Serve immediately sprinkled with spring onions. 
            </li>
        </ol>
